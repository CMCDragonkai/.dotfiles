# Not all executables work using Windows symlinks due to relative addressing
# A little hack to solve this problem is by removing the extension for the symlink name
# Symlinks without extensions won't be executable directly in CMD
# However you can explicitly use `start program-name` in CMD
# Powershell will autostart executables that have no extension
# Cygwin doesn't care
# Occasionally the extension will be needed for some reason
# You can either add both the extension-less and extension-full versions
# Or you can just add one of them
# It relies on testing on what works and what doesn't
