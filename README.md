# .dotfiles #

This directory is meant to be located in `~/.dotfiles`. It's files are supposed to be symlinked into `~`.

We can should have a bash script that basically symlinks only files and creates folders. Nothing else.

External dependencies are managed via git submodules. This facilitates component based development, where these dependencies have their own life cycle.

```
# add the master branch of prezto as a submodule
git submodule add -b master git@github.com:sorin-ionescu/prezto.git
# update the submodule to the latest master
git submodule update --remote prezto
```

Installation is:

```
cd ~
git clone --recursive git@github.com:CMCDragonkai/.dotfiles.git
```

SSH Keys are not stored in `~/.ssh` and the `~/.ssh/hosts` file is not stored there either. Make sure to securely transfer all keys and hosts file into `~/.ssh` before using.

```
scp ~/.ssh/identity cmcdragonkai@X.X.X.X:~/.ssh/identity
scp ~/.ssh/identity.ppl cmcdragonkai@X.X.X.X:~/.ssh/identity.ppk
scp ~/.ssh/hosts cmcdragonkai@X.X.X.X:~/.ssh/hosts
scp -r ~/.ssh/keys/ cmcdragonkai@X.X.X.X:~/.ssh/keys
```
