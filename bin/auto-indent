# auto-indent.sh
# should auto detect the code (doesn't need to be smart, just the indentation characters of () [] {}) and just
# automatically create newlines between those characters
# can be a bit heuristic about it, shorter lines (within 70 characters will be left as is)
# longer will be indented
# will not deal with ones that are already indented
# indentation should be 4 spaces or a tab
# what if things are partially indented? kind of like (\n\n blah \n), it's not a code formatter or beautifer
# also things like `;`...?
