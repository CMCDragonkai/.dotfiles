#!/usr/bin/env sh

# to run something as administrator, we must elevate to the windows system
# but this makes windows run the executable as a completely separate program 
# which means IO is not inlined into the existing terminal you ran sudo with
# however, this is fastest way to run something as administrator through cygwin 
# note that many commands will make the terminal window exit, if you need 
# to see output, you must wrap the program in a shell
# further note, that pipes will not work here either
